There was a lot of really great music this year, this was definitely a hard list to make. These are just my opinions and by limiting myself to five I really tried to pick albums that I couldn't stop playing.  

But first I want to start off this album list by mentioning some EPs.  
  
  

## JPEGMAFIA - EP!
[Listen here.](https://jpegmafia.bandcamp.com/album/ep)  
No music list of mine would be complete without mentioning JPEGMAFIA. After releasing two great albums Veteran (2018) and All My Heroes Are Cornballs (2019), he spent this past year dropping loose singles.
Which EP! bundles up, adding some intros and outros to a few songs; fleshing them out further. JPEGMAFIA is one of the most creative producers in the game right now.

## Slauson Malone - Vergangenheitsbew√§ltigung (Crater Speak)
[Listen here.](https://slausonmalone.bandcamp.com/album/vergangenheitsbew-ltigung-crater-speak)  
This EP sounds like listening to someone's memory of music. I love the combination of classical instruments and glitchy distortions. To me there is a narrative through the ambience and mood, while not sticking to one idea for too long.
I feel like that's a lot of words that don't say a whole lot, but I'm not really sure how to describe this one. It's something you have to check out for yourself.
I will say my favorite part is during the final song, when you can hear the mechanical switching of notes on the saxophone (I think?), feeling the player's breath through the instrument, and it all builds up to this static storm that swells and releases. That sentence won't appeal to everyone but it is undeniably unique.

## Tkay Maidza - Last Year Was Weird, Vol. 2
[Listen here.](https://soundcloud.com/tkaymaidza/sets/last-year-was-weird-vol-2)  
This thing is a banger, every track just HITS. There's a few different styles on this EP and Tkay nails them all. From the aggressive bass-fueled Shook, to You Sad which the hook sounds like it was made for Tik Tok.
I am very excited to see what Tkay does next.

## Top Albums 2020

## 5. Dorian Electra - My Agenda
[Listen here.](https://dorianelectra.bandcamp.com/album/my-agenda)  
Hyper-pop is my guilty pleasure. So having Dylan Brady from 100 Gecs on a project with Dorian Electra is a no brainer for me. This was probably the most fun album to come out this year.
I love the way it takes language and sounds that are used negatively and makes them their own. The "Gay Agenda", "love who you want but don't ram it down my throat", using the imagery of incel culture to deliver clever social commentary.  
If you only hear one song off this album listen to *My Agenda*.

## 4. Laura Marling - Song For Our Daughter
[Listen here.](https://lauramarling.bandcamp.com/album/song-for-our-daughter)  
Despite Marling's career spanning over a decade at this point, I don't think anything in her discography matches the polish here. The instrumentation is minimal, the writing is vulnerable yet confident. I can't think of any other album that made me shed more tears this year. Best singer/songwriter album for me. (Sorry Phoebe Bridgers I promise you were a very close second.)  
If you only hear one song off this album listen to the title track, *Song For Our Daughter*.

## 3. Denzel Curry, Kenny Beats - Unlocked
[Listen here.](https://denzelcurrymusic.bandcamp.com/album/unlocked)  
This album is short and sweet, probably my most listened to album of the year. Gets my hyped up every time. I usually would put it on when programming, and suddenly there is no problem I cannot face.
Seriously though, the beats don't miss. Denzel is sounding mean. The production is reminiscent of Madvillainy era MF DOOM. What more could you ask for?  
If you only hear one song off this album listen to *_DIET*.

## 2. clipping. - Visions of Bodies Being Burned
[Listen here.](https://clppng.bandcamp.com/album/visions-of-bodies-being-burned)  
This is not just a Halloween album. Say it with me "This is not just a Halloween album." Yes it released in October, yes it's filled with gruesome horror stories. From Friday the 13th-esque slasher, to ghost stories, and just that unsettling feeling that you're not alone. It has those things, but it also has some of the most unique sounds on any experimental hip hop record this year. One track's instrumental is entirely pots and pans banging and I am here for it. Plus Daveed Diggs' bars are just so clever. Where else am I supposed to go hear someone reference Picasso's *Guernica* in a rap song?  
If you only hear one song off this album listen to *Say the Name*.

## 1. HMLTD - West of Eden
[Listen here.](https://hmltd.bandcamp.com/album/west-of-eden)  
Finally, my number one. The clash of genres contained within this album, on paper, do not make any sense. However, HMLTD does the impossible: revitalizes glam punk and combines it with trap and western elements. But there's more than that, the different sounds on display here; HMLTD fully explores this area of post-punk art pop. I love the topics covered, from "the fall of the west" to feelings of gender dysphoria. It's theatric. It's honest. I could gush about this album for awhile, but I could not get anyone to listen to it. Please don't let this one slip by.  
If you only hear one song off this album listen to *Blank Slate*.
