## Simple
This website is built using a static site generator, [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). The posts are written in markdown, which is parsed
to HTML by Gatsby. This makes the site fast by default as it has no extra cruft. No tracking scripts either.

## Responsive
Using TailwindCSS this website looks exactly how I intended on both desktop, mobile, and anywhere in between. That doesn't make it a good design, but at 
least it was on purpose.
